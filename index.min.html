Their style has traditionally been an amalgamation of hard rock and light metal with some classical influences, but shifted to became more alternative after their third album. In reviews, critics have compared RED to bands like Linkin Park, Breaking Benjamin, and Chevelle. Since 2014, the band's line-up has consisted of the core trio of the Armstrongs and Barnes with touring drummer Dan Johnson.<p>After they recorded several demos that displayed a style of alternative, hard, and Christian rock music, RED landed a development deal with their longtime producer Rob Graves which led to a record deal with Essential Records in 2004. Their debut albums <i>End of Silence</i> (2006) and <i>Innocence & Instinct</i> (2009) were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album, and spawned the popular singles "Breathe Into Me" and "Death of Me". The band's mainstream popularity grew rapidly and their third album, <i>Until We Have Faces</i> (2011), reached No. 2 on the <i>Billboard 200</i>, followed by <i>Release the Panic</i> (2013), which peaked at No. 7. After <i>Of Beauty and Rage</i> (2015), Red started work on their sixth album, <i>Gone</i> (2017), which released later in the Fall rather than the usual late Winter to early Spring.</div><h2>Meet the Band</h2><div class="mx-auto col-lg-10 card-deck col-xl-8"><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><div class="card border-secondary"><div class=row><div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-12"><img src=_images/blank.png class=card-img-top alt=""id=card-img-1></div><div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-12"><div class=card-block><h3 class="card-title first">Michael Barnes</h3><div class=card-subtitle><p>Lead Vocals<br>2002 - Present</div><div class=card-footer><span class=card-link><button class="btn btn-outline-light btn-big"data-target=#bio1 data-toggle=modal><i class="fa fa-user"></i> Bio</button> </span><span class=card-link><a href=https://twitter.com/mikeredmusic class="btn btn-outline-light btn-big"target=blank><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i> Twitter</a></span></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="fade modal"id=bio1><div class=modal-dialog><div class=modal-content><div class=modal-body><button class="btn btn-danger btn-x"type=button aria-label=close data-dismiss=modal><i class="fa fa-times"></i></button> <img src=_images/michael-md.jpg class=bio-pic><h3>Michael Barnes</h3><p>Born March 10, 1979 in Cleveland, Ohio, Michael's family moved to Linesville, Pennsylvania as a child, where he met the Armstrong twins in elementary school.
